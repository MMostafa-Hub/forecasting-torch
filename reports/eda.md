# Introduction

This tutorial explores the realm of time series forecasting with a comprehensive weather dataset provided by [Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Biogeochemie](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/) spanning various meteorological parameters like`air temperature`, `atmospheric pressure`, and `humidity`, the dataset captures readings at 10-minute intervals, commencing in 2003. Our focus will be on the subset of data from 2009 to 2016.

Our Task is to predict the `Temperature` one day in advance, given the weather conditions for the past day. We will be using the `Temperature` column as our target variable.

# EDA

Upon looking for the `df.info()` output we get the following

```txt
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 420551 entries, 0 to 420550
    Data columns (total 15 columns):

- The column names are not very intuitive and we need to rename them.
- We can see that there are no null values in the dataset.
- The `Date Time` column is of type `object` and we need to convert it to `datetime` type.
- The `Date Time` column is the index of the dataframe.

## Data Visualizations

Upon plotting the data we get the following:
![All Features Plot](./images/image.png)

- There are some noise in the dataset, we may consider resampling the data to be hourly instead of every 10 minutes.
- `Wind speed` and `Max wind speed` have an outlier, that makes the plot not very readable. We will remove it.
- `Temp (kelvin)` is the same as `Temp` but in Kelvin. We will remove it.
- `Wind Direction` is oscillating between 0 and 360 degrees.
- Being weather data, it has clear daily and yearly periodicity. So, we will add `time of day` and `month of year` as features.

## Correlations

```

- `Temp` and `Temp (Kelvin)` are highly correlated, we will remove `Temp (Kelvin)`.
- There's nearly no correlation between `Wind speed` and `Max wind speed` and `Temp`.
- Consider creating a new feature creates a `Wind Vector` from `Wind speed` and `Wind Direction`, that might be more correlated with `Temp`.
- `Max wind speed` is highly correlated with `Wind speed`, we will remove `Max wind speed`.
